**Inferred Hierarchical Clustering of Spotify Genres**

This project implements an approach to improve the classification accuracy of fine-grain music genres by introducing inferred hierarchical information to a deep learning model. We use metadata provided by Spotify’s API (for example, the tempo, valence, and "danceability" of a song, among other features) and create an ”embedding” that represents songs using normalized features. To infer hierarchical relationships among genres, we create an Inferred Hierarchical Classification Tree (IHCT) through hierarchical clustering. The IHCT is used as input to a deep neural network, inspired by YOLO/YOLOv3 architecture, to classify the songs into genres. While we introduced a novel approach to incorporating inferred hierarchical information into a deep learning model, we found it performed roughly equivalent to a simpler approach, but its results could prove useful for specific use cases.
